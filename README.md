This game was made exclusively on a computer in my Personal Finance class during my senior year of high school when I probably should have been doing other things. It's okay though, I got an A in the class. There is a glitch to score 9 every time; see if you can figure it out.

## How to Play
1. Click the Start button.
2. Hold the backspace key, and release.
3. The last number that wasn't erased when you release your cursor is your score for that frame.
4. Click OK in the popup, or press enter to go to the next frame.

The object of the game is to score the highest number you can every frame, which is 9.

The highest possible score of a perfect game is 90.
